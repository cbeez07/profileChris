                <p class="flow-text">I have always loved technology, strategy games, and troubleshooting. After working on the hardware side of technology for ten years, I am moving to the software side by becoming a full stack developer. I believe my passion for technology, strategy,
                        and troubleshooting make me a perfect fit for being a software developer.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p class="flow-text">I have a passion for trying to understand people and what they believe and how they think, which is why I chose to study theology during college. This has helped shape me to become someone who can get along with people. Since college I have worked
                        with and become friends with many diverse people through my work. Throughout my adult life, I have worked as part of a team, which has helped me to keep calm during tough times, trust my teammates, and learn how important communication is between
                        teammates.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p class="flow-text">After reflecting on my life, there are a few things I am very proud of. The first is how I have been able to work my way through two different companies. At Madison Chemical, I started as an administrative assistant and became a technical sales
                        representative. At TEA, I started as a field service engineer level 1, and ended as one of the two leads on my shift. The second is I taught myself how to program a PLC, which helped Madison Chemical gain and keep a lot of clients. The thing I
                        am most proud of is my family, my wife and twin boys.</p>
